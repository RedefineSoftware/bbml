## BBML
### Breadboard Markup Language

* Useful for making [breadboards](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding)
* Language was heavily influenced by [DBML](https://www.dbml.org/docs/), [dbml-renderer](https://github.com/softwaretechnik-berlin/dbml-renderer) 
* Terminology was borrowed from Ben Nadel's [proof-of-concept breadboarding app](https://breadboarding-poc.netlify.app)
* Parser is auto-generated using [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org/documentation) based off of the `breadboarder.pegjs` grammar
